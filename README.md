#### What is Machine Learning?

Arthur Samuel: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." 

Tom Mitchell: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Rules for normalized tables:

1. Every row has the same number of columns.

2. There is a unique key and everything in a row says something about the key.

3. Facts that don't relate to the key belong in different tables.

4. Tables shouldn't imply relationships that don't exist.
