# Support Vector Machine

Support vector machine is also called large margin classifier. 

## Notes
For the lost function, conventionally, in logistic regression, we use the form of A+&lambda;B for the lost function, but in SVM, we use CA + B. The larger the &lambda; or smaller the C, the larger the regularization, the less sensitive it is to outliers.
