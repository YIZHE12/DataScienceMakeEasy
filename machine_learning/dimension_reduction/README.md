Covariance:

A positive covariance told you there are a positive slope between the two features, 
and a negative covvariance told you the slope is negative.

If covariance = 0, that means there is no relationship between the two features.

Covariance itself is difficult to interpret but it is often the first step for other analysis, such as correlation and PCA.

Correlation 

It is between -1 and 1. When it is 1 or -1, means all data go through a staright line, but doesn't tell you the slope.
We have low cofidence on correlation when the data set is small.
