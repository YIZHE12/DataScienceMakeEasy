## Binary search
Use the divide and conqueue algorithm, to cut the sorted array by half and compare.

## Sort
### Bubble sort
Compare every two elements one by one for N-1 times, each time, the largest element will bubble up to the right. It is an inplace algorithm that doesn't require extra memory.

Time complexicity: O(N^2)

Space complexicity: O(1)

### Merge sort
Another example of divide and conqueue

Time complexicity: O(NlogN)

Space complexicity: O(N)
