# Data Structures

## Link List
In python, every time when you insert an element to a list, new storage of the entire list will be created and the elemenets need to be shifted to move room. This means it is quite not efficient when the list is large. Therefore, in this situation, we used link list instead, which doesn't recreate the storage neither does it require shifting. However, it does eliminate the constant time direct element access available with the array and Python list. As its name implies, the link strucutre has to been accessed based on the 'link order'. The singly linked list is a linear structure in which traversals start at the front and progress, one element at a time, to the end. Other variations include the circularly linked, the doubly linked, and the circularly doubly linked lists.
